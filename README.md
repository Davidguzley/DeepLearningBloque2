## About The Project

In Mexico, 10 million tons of food are lost annually -37% of production- during the production phase. It is possible to identify two large food groups, one with less waste: zucchini, tomato, carrots; orange, papaya and grape; tuna and tortilla. (La Jornada, 2020).

The demand for fruits is always there at any time whether people choose to buy fruit in traditional markets, in supermarkets, buy online and even export abroad. But the problem is that sometimes there are long queues in sorting the types of fruit to be sent abroad or there are long queues to pay at the cashier. Some cases of problems, among others:

- Why are some fruits delivered late so the fruit is not in good condition?

- Why do you have to wait in long queues to pay for fruit at the cashier?

Objective : 

Based on the problems that have been described at the beginning, I tried to use an artificial network of image processing that can classify the types of fruit, so that what will be sent can arrive on time without sorting the fruit manually and customers waiting in long lines to buy fruit because the cashier detects the type of fruit to be made purchased by the customer.
